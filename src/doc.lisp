  "
It is common knowledge that Uganda is a low trust society. As such, people find it very difficult to conduct businesses online because of high rates of counterfeighting and fraud. We want to change that. Or at least we want to enforce trust on our systems, because trust doesn't just develop, trust is supposed to be enforced. We will begin by collecting all posible data we can on an individual, then track them as they use the site, then use this data to counter fraud. We should be able to track a person with maximum accuracy when they use the site. In a way, we are becoming an private investigative agency to booster growth and adoption of ecommerce in the country. This practice is also very good because it can allow targeting with sufficient accuracy. So collecting vast amounts of data will increase both value delivered to advertisers and also increase trust in the system, the later has such great reach even beyond our current confines.

** Before and after 256

We have to take note of where the user comes from and where they go after visiting our site, this will be helpful in:

1. Analysing traffic trends sent to various websites which can easily be made an argument for when looking to sell ad space.
2. Behavioural analysis: what kinds of visit which sites, also will be good for targeting and classifying users.")
